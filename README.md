# ü§ñ Basic ADK Agent: Greeting Agent Example

## üéØ Overview
This project contains the most basic implementation of an AI agent using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. 

The agent, named `greeting_agent`, is configured to use the `gemini-2.0-flash` model and is instructed to initiate a conversation by asking the user's name and then greeting them.

üîë Set Up API Key
This project requires a Gemini API Key. Since the .env file is excluded from Git for security, you must create it manually.

1.Get your API key from Google AI Studio.

2.Navigate to the greeting-agent folder.

3.Create a new file named .env inside the greeting-agent folder.

4.Add your key inside the file:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Agent
Run the adk web command from the root directory of your project (ADK-Course) to launch the interactive developer UI.

Bash

# Run this from the root folder containing the 'greeting-agent' subdirectory
adk web greeting-agent
Access the web interface at the provided local URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev-ui/).

Select greeting_agent from the dropdown menu in the top-left corner.

Type a message to start interacting with your agent!
